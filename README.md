# GiphySearch

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Project requires an API Key for Giphy.com, This and the Host prefix are set up in .env file. This will be included in the email I sent.

If on localhost and you have some CORS issues, you may need to run a proxy to hit the API if. There are a couple work arounds for this, including temporarily disabling CORS in the Chrome Browser.
